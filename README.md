# SiwaTestnet

**Auto Connect Wallet**

---

## Overview

**SiwaTestnet** is a Python-based tool that automates the process of connecting a wallet to a testnet environment. This project uses browser automation to simulate user actions, making it ideal for testing, development, and demonstration purposes in blockchain and crypto projects.

---

## Features

- 🚀 **Auto Connects Wallet** to a testnet web interface
- 🤖 Uses Python and browser automation for seamless interaction
- 🧪 Perfect for testing dApps or wallet integrations
- 🛠️ Easily customizable for different testnet environments

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [pyppeteer](https://github.com/pyppeteer/pyppeteer) (for browser automation)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AndreiPlazzaSouza/SiwaTestnet.git
    cd SiwaTestnet
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pyppeteer
    ```

---

## Usage

The main script is `siwa.py`. It automates connecting a wallet to your testnet dApp or interface.

```bash
python siwa.py
```

By default, the script will:

- Launch a browser window
- Navigate to the specified testnet page
- Simulate the wallet connection process

> **Note:**  
> - You may need to adjust CSS selectors in `siwa.py` to match the actual web interface of your testnet.
> - For MetaMask or browser extension wallets, additional setup may be required.

## Example (Pseudo-code)

```python
import asyncio
from pyppeteer import launch

async def auto_connect_wallet():
    browser = await launch(headless=False)
    page = await browser.newPage()
    await page.goto('https://your-testnet-dapp-url.com')
    await page.click('button.connect-wallet')  # Adjust selector as needed
    await asyncio.sleep(5)
    await browser.close()

asyncio.run(auto_connect_wallet())
```
